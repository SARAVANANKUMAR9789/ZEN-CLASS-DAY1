Difference between document and window object?

Document Object Model.

   When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The document object 
   represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags). 
   It is the root element that represents the html document.

Window Vs Document.

    The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property
   of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

    You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly
   as window is global object. In the below example, title is the property of document object.   
    
   The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods.
   Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. In the below example window.
   open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.
